The following key values are inserted into a B+ ‐ tree in which order of the internal nodes is 3, and that of the leaf nodes is 2, in the sequence given below. The order of internal nodes is the maximum number of tree pointers in each node, and the order of leaf nodes is the maximum number of data items that can be stored in it. The B+ ‐ tree is initially empty. 10, 3, 6, 8, 4, 2, 1 .The maximum number of times leaf nodes would get split up as a result of these insertion is The following key values are inserted into a B+ ‐ tree in which order of the internal nodes is 3, and that of the leaf nodes is 2, in the sequence given below.
